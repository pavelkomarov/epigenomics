Read `a letter to whomever follows.pdf`, my final report designed to allow the project to continue in my absence.

`code` contains the various scripts in my data pipeline. A diagram of how they fit together and descriptions of what they are for are in the letter.

`data` doesn't have all the data. There were maybe hundreds of MB of methylation numbers in `0 GSE74193 GEO procData.csv`. Too large, and that data doesn't belong to me. Still, I wanted to include the smaller ones to show some of what I was dealing with.

`doc` contains everything necessary to create the report.
